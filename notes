the dimnesions are configurable - just a way to distribute the keys?


mostly questions about how functions work - seems like the part of the paper that was left unimplemented

about the functions:
How do the `weights` and `overlay_` work?
can they work concurrently with regular hashing?
can object stored with a certain formula be retreived with another formula that captures the objects' properties?

formulas are essentially a specification of the "type" of the object --
they are used to narrow down the query space

There may be an ideal number of dimnesions based on the details of the data in the system

I should start implementing the paper and write out verifiable test cases for my implementation - should probably ask what language I should be using - might make sense to brush up on some nodejs

I need to show proportional enthusiasm so that the prof is more motivated to help -- deadlines are STRICT -- schedule class stuff, life stuff with this in mind -- this is an equal priority
